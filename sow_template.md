## 1. Game Selection & Scope (Sprint 0)

> Planning is going to be an iterative process through the sprints so you don't have to have all the details now. Focus on big overview concepts. You will be updating the SOW as we plan.
> You have a lot of freedom to choose a game. There are a couple caveats.  

> - It must run in the console. The lab nodes won't be able to handle extensive graphics.
> - It has to be self-contained. You can use a internet-connector to download you code, but because the architecture must run 5 nodes you won't be able to run 
> - You are encouraged to use python, but I'm not going to make it a strict requirement. The instructor and TA's ability to help with C or Rust, etc will be diminished in other languages.

### 1.1 Game Overview
- **Chosen Game:** Terminal Trivia
- **Player Capacity:** 2 Players (Simulated via 2 CML Client nodes)
- **Game Summary:** This game will consist of two players competing against each other by answering 10 multiple choice, networking-related questions. The questions will progressively become harder as the game progresses. Players will alternate turns answering one question before the turn passes to the next player. Each question will have a 10 second time limit. A correct answer will be worth 1 point and a wrong answer or no answer will result in no points being given to the player for that question. Players’ scores will be tracked separately.
Each player will also have access to 2 hints and 1 question swap per game to assist them. A player using a hint will receive additional information to help them answer the question while a question swap enables them to swap out the current question for a new one. Swapping out a question will restart the 10 second window to allow the player enough time to answer the new question. The game will also include streak bonuses. If a player answers 3 or more answers correctly, they will receive bonus points added to their score. Using a hint or question swap will not affect end a streak, but an incorrect answer or no answer within the 10 second limit will reset the player’s streak.

### 1.2 Core Game Rules & Win/Draw Conditions
- **Turn Mechanics:** [Explain how turn order is enforced between Player 1 and Player 2]
- **Victory Condition:** After the 10 questions have been completed, the player with the highest score will be the winner. 
- **Draw/Tie Condition:** If the players have the same number of points at the end of the game, they will enter a tie breaker round which will follow the same rules as the main game except neither player will be allowed to use any of their remaining helps. The first player to answer a tie breaker question will win.

## 2. Application-Layer Messaging Protocol Blueprint (Sprint 1 Deliverable)

### 2.1 Message Transport & Serialization Format
- **Transport Protocol:** TCP
- **Serialization Format:** [JSON / Fixed-Header Binary / Delimited Text]
- **Framing Mechanism:** [e.g., Newline-delimited (`\n`) JSON payloads OR 4-byte big-endian length prefix]

### 2.2 Message Schema Definitions

#### Message Types:
1. `CONNECT` (Client -> Server): Request to join the game room.
2. `LOBBY_WAIT` (Server -> Client): Notification that server is waiting for Player 2.
3. `GAME_START` (Server -> Clients): Game initiated, assigns roles (e.g. Player X vs Player O).
4. `MOVE` (Client -> Server): Player action (e.g., cell coordinates or answer choice).
5. `STATE_UPDATE` (Server -> Clients): Broadcast current game board / state and active player turn.
6. `GAME_OVER` (Server -> Clients): Victory / Draw notification with final scores.
7. `ERROR` (Server -> Client): Invalid move or malformed packet error.

#### Example JSON Protocol Schema:
```json
{
  "msg_type": "MOVE",
  "player_id": "Player_1",
  "payload": {
    "row": 0,
    "col": 2
  },
  "timestamp": 1727000000
}
```

### 2.3 Game State Machine (FSM) Design (Sprint 1 Deliverable)
- **State Transitions:** Detail state flow: `INIT` -> `WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS` -> `PLAYER_TURN` -> `EVALUATE_MOVE` -> `CHECK_WIN_DRAW` -> `GAME_OVER` -> `CLEANUP`.

---

## 3. Game Behavior & Server Concurrency Architecture (Sprint 2 Deliverable)

### 3.1 Server Concurrency Strategy
- **Architecture Choice:** [Multi-Threading (`threading.Thread`) OR Non-blocking I/O multiplexing (`select.select` / `selectors`)]
- **Synchronization Logic:** Explain how shared game state and client list are thread-safe (e.g. `threading.Lock`) to prevent race conditions during turn processing.

### 3.2 State & Score Synchronization Across Clients
- **Turn Enforcement:** Detail how the server validates active player ID before processing moves and broadcasts updated turn notifications to all clients.
- **Score & Board Synchronization:** Describe how state broadcasts keep client screens synchronized in real time.

---

## 4. Coding & AI Implementation Plan (Sprint 3)

- **Permitted AI Tools:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude]
- **AI Prompting & Constraint Strategy:** Explain how you will constrain AI models to generate code (in Python or your chosen language) that adheres strictly to the protocol blueprint and FSM designed in Sprints 1 & 2.
- **Implementation Risk Management:** Detail your plan to leverage past programming experience and manage time to ensure code completion on schedule.

## 5. CML Multi-Subnet Topology & Wireshark Deployment Plan (Sprint 4 & 5 Deliverable)

> For now you can use the topology below. We may update this when we get to defining subnets.

### 5.1 Subnet & Router Design
- **Subnet A (Client 1):** `192.168.10.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/1` on Router R1)
- **Subnet B (Client 2):** `192.168.11.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/2` on Router R1)
- **Subnet C (Game Server):** `192.168.20.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/1` on Router R2)
- **Router Backbone:** `10.0.0.0/30` (Interface `Gi0/0` on R1 <-> `Gi0/0` on R2)

### 5.2 DHCP Pools & DNS Configuration Plan
- **Router R1 DHCP Pool 1 (`CLIENT1_POOL`):** Leases `192.168.10.10` - `192.168.10.50`, gateway `192.168.10.1`, DNS `10.0.0.2`.
- **Router R1 DHCP Pool 2 (`CLIENT2_POOL`):** Leases `192.168.11.10` - `192.168.11.50`, gateway `192.168.11.1`, DNS `10.0.0.2`.
- **Router R2 Authoritative DNS:** Configured with `ip dns server` and static host mapping `server.[yourlastname].edu` -> `192.168.20.100`.

### 5.3 Deployment Strategy & Wireshark Trace Capture
- **CML Deployment Strategy:** Deploy `server.py` onto Subnet C node (`192.168.20.100`) behind Router R2, and `client.py` onto Subnet A and Subnet B nodes behind Router R1.
- **Cisco Infrastructure Configuration:** Router R1 DHCP pools (`CLIENT1_POOL`, `CLIENT2_POOL`) and Router R2 authoritative DNS (`ip host server.[lastname].edu 192.168.20.100`).
- **Wireshark Trace Capture Plan:** Capture DHCP DORA exchange (`dhcp_negotiation.pcap`) and DNS query/response resolution (`dns_lookup.pcap`).
